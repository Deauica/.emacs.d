# About EMACS

Emacs changes how you *think* about programming.

Emacs is **totally introspectable**. You can always find out 'what code runs when I press this button?'.

Emacs is an **incremental programming environment**. There's no edit-compile-run cycle. There isn't even an edit-run cycle. You can execute snippets of code and gradually turn them into a finished project. There's no distinction between your editor and your interpreter.

Emacs is a **mutable environment**. You can set variables, tweak functions with advice, or redefine entire functions. Nothing is off-limits.

Emacs provides **functionality without applications**. Rather than separate applications, functionality is all integrated into your Emacs instance. Amazingly, this works. Ever wanted to use the same snippet tool for writing C++ classes as well as emails?

Emacs is full of **incredible software concepts that haven't hit the mainstream yet**. For example:

-   Many platforms have a single item clipboard. Emacs has an **infinite clipboard**.
-   If you undo a change, and then continue editing, you can't redo the original change. Emacs allows **undoing to any historical state**, even allowing tree-based exploration of history.
-   Emacs supports a **reverse variable search**: you can find variables with a given value.
-   You can perform **structural editing** of code, allowing you to make changes without breaking syntax. This works for lisps (paredit) and non-lisps (smartparens).
-   Many applications use a modal GUI: for example, you can't do other edits during a find-and-replace operation. Emacs provides **recursive editing** that allow you to suspend what you're currently doing, perform other edits, then continue the original task.

Emacs has a **documentation culture**. Emacs includes a usage manual, a lisp programming manual, pervasive docstrings and even an interactive tutorial.

Emacs has a **broad ecosystem**. If you want to edit code in a niche language, there's probably an Emacs package for it.

Emacs doesn't have a monopoly on good ideas, and there are other great tools out there. Nonetheless, we believe the [Emacs learning curve](https://i.stack.imgur.com/7Cu9Z.jpg) pays off.

# About M-EMACS

M-EMACS is a custom GNU Emacs setup and configurations that aims not only to enhance the default Emacs experience, and hopefully be a sample that everyone can easily navigate and reference through a highly detailed README that contains 99% of the **entire** configuration code.

As a young EMACSer, I have experienced the struggle to find a detailed configuration that is loosely coupled and highly readable. This mostly due to the nature of source codes, sometimes comments are harder to notice or simply not enough. Therefore I decided to construct this README and present any human-readable explanation in a much more human-friendly way. Anyone, particularly Emacs beginners who have no idea where to start with their personal config, is more than welcome to read through this document and copy/paste any part to use it on their own.

This configuration is designed and tested for **GNU Emacs 26.1 and above only**. However, it is suggested to use **emacs27**, the latest version currently available.

## About README

This README is originated from `init.org` that is generated using `M-x org-gfm-export-to-markdown`. Every block of code is generated through this function - it exports sections of code from the `elisp/` directory. You will not see their presence in `init.org`.


<a id="org5905fd7"></a>

## Community Responses ❤️

Some heartwarming responses from the Emacs community:

-   *"Actually I understated how much I liked reading through your config&#x2026; What makes me excited about this config is the readability and possibility of extending in a similar way."* &#x2013; from [u/Orgmonics](https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/eewwyh/officially_introducing_memacs/fc5x1lz?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)
-   *"I have to say Matt's setup has the best clarity of all emacs setups I have ever tried. It's really a good template to develop your own emacs config. Thanks again&#x2026;"* &#x2013; from [u/fqye](https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/eewwyh/officially_introducing_memacs/fbxk831?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)
-   *"Thank you for helping a guy out and for sharing this. I hope this evolves to be into something really big."* &#x2013; from [d3v-S](https://github.com/MatthewZMD/.emacs.d/issues/38#issuecomment-706657288)
-   and more&#x2026; Love you guys! ❤️❤️

## Installation

1.  Install [GNU Emacs](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/).
    -   (Optional) On Ubuntu, `emacs-snapshot` is a great way to get latest version of Emacs.

        ```bash
        sudo add-apt-repository -y ppa:ubuntu-elisp
        sudo apt-get update
        sudo apt-get install emacs-snapshot
        ```
    -   (Optional) Build latest Emacs from source.

        ```bash
        # Install essential build tools
        sudo apt-get install build-essential texinfo libx11-dev libxpm-dev libjpeg-dev libpng-dev libgif-dev libtiff-dev libgtk2.0-dev libncurses-dev gnutls-dev libgtk-3-dev git autoconf
        # Clone source
        git clone --depth=1 https://github.com/emacs-mirror/emacs.git
        # Go to source
        cd emacs/
        # Build Emacs
        ./autogen.sh
        ./configure --with-mailutils
        make
        # Install (optional)
        sudo make install
        ```
2.  Clone this repo to `HOME` or `~/` path using [git](https://git-scm.com/) and update all the submodules.

    ```bash
    cd ~
    git clone --recurse-submodules -j8 https://github.com/MatthewZMD/.emacs.d.git
    cd .emacs.d
    ```
3.  Ensure a stable connection to Melpa Packages, then open Emacs.
4.  Enter `y` when prompted with `Auto-update packages now?`, wait for all packages to install.
5.  In your favorite browser, `Ctrl-f Prerequisite` through this README and follow the **Prerequisite** instructions.
6.  Restart Emacs.


### Further Updates

I will be updating M-EMACS from time to time, it is best to `git pull` once a while to stay up to date.

Please also execute `git submodule update --recursive --remote` to sync with all the submodules.


<a id="org4959a57"></a>

## Modification

You have the permission to use, modify, distribute in any way you want.

However, what is *free* stays *free*. After all, this is [GPL](LICENSE).

**Remember** you must manually sync this README with all the new changes you made by:

1.  Please do **NOT** edit this `README.md` file, edit `init.org` instead!
2.  If you add a new mode, create a new `<file-name>.el` file in `elisp/` directory.
3.  Put `(require '<file-name>)` in [init.el](init.el) accordingly.
4.  Add `#+INCLUDE: "~/.emacs.d/elisp/<place-holder>.el" src emacs-lisp :range-begin "<start-line-wrapper-exclusive>" :range-end "<end-line-wrapper-exclusive>"` in the appropriate section in `init.org`.
5.  Enter `C-x C-s` to save and update `:lines`. (if you don't see the updated effect, run `M-x save-and-update-includes` manually)
6.  Call `M-x org-gfm-export-to-markdown` to update `README.md` automatically.

# Startup


<a id="orgf4d21b0"></a>

## Lexical Binding

Use lexical-binding. [Why?](https://nullprogram.com/blog/2016/12/22/)

> Until Emacs 24.1 (June 2012), Elisp only had dynamically scoped variables, a feature, mostly by accident, common to old lisp dialects. While dynamic scope has some selective uses, it’s widely regarded as a mistake for local variables, and virtually no other languages have adopted it.

```emacs-lisp
;;; init.el --- -*- lexical-binding: t -*-
```


<a id="org2a366df"></a>

## Early Init

Emacs27 introduces `early-init.el`, which is run before `init.el`, before package and UI initialization happens.


### Compatibility With 26

Ensure `emacs-version>=26`, manually require `early-init` configurations if `emacs-version<27`.

```emacs-lisp
(cond ((version< emacs-version "26.1")
       (warn "M-EMACS requires Emacs 26.1 and above!"))
      ((let* ((early-init-f (expand-file-name "early-init.el" user-emacs-directory))
              (early-init-do-not-edit-d (expand-file-name "early-init-do-not-edit/" user-emacs-directory))
              (early-init-do-not-edit-f (expand-file-name "early-init.el" early-init-do-not-edit-d)))
         (and (version< emacs-version "27")
              (or (not (file-exists-p early-init-do-not-edit-f))
                  (file-newer-than-file-p early-init-f early-init-do-not-edit-f)))
         (make-directory early-init-do-not-edit-d t)
         (copy-file early-init-f early-init-do-not-edit-f t t t t)
         (add-to-list 'load-path early-init-do-not-edit-d)
         (require 'early-init))))
```


### Defer Garbage Collection

Defer garbage collection further back in the startup process, according to [hlissner](https://github.com/hlissner/doom-emacs/blob/develop/docs/faq.org#how-does-doom-start-up-so-quickly).

> The GC eats up quite a bit of time, easily doubling startup time. The trick is to turn up the memory threshold as early as possible.

```emacs-lisp
(setq gc-cons-threshold 100000000)
```


### Disable `package-enable-at-startup`

Package initialize occurs automatically, before `user-init-file` is loaded, but after `early-init-file`. We handle package initialization, so we must prevent Emacs from doing it early!

```emacs-lisp
(setq package-enable-at-startup nil)
```


### Unset `file-name-handler-alist`

Every file opened and loaded by Emacs will run through this list to check for a proper handler for the file, but during startup, it won’t need any of them.

```emacs-lisp
(defvar file-name-handler-alist-original file-name-handler-alist)
(setq file-name-handler-alist nil)
```


### Disable `site-run-file`

```emacs-lisp
(setq site-run-file nil)
```


### Disable Unnecessary Interface

It will be faster to disable them here before they've been initialized.

```emacs-lisp
(menu-bar-mode -1)
(unless (and (display-graphic-p) (eq system-type 'darwin))
  (push '(menu-bar-lines . 0) default-frame-alist))
(push '(tool-bar-lines . 0) default-frame-alist)
(push '(vertical-scroll-bars) default-frame-alist)
```


<a id="org22cada3"></a>

## Garbage Collection


### Set `gc-cons-threshold` Smaller for Interactive Use

A large `gc-cons-threshold` may cause freezing and stuttering during long-term interactive use.

If you experience freezing, decrease this amount, if you increase stuttering, increase this amount.

```emacs-lisp
(defvar better-gc-cons-threshold 134217728 ; 128mb
  "The default value to use for `gc-cons-threshold'.

If you experience freezing, decrease this.  If you experience stuttering, increase this.")

(add-hook 'emacs-startup-hook
          (lambda ()
            (setq gc-cons-threshold better-gc-cons-threshold)
            (setq file-name-handler-alist file-name-handler-alist-original)
            (makunbound 'file-name-handler-alist-original)))
```

Garbage Collect when Emacs is out of focus and avoid garbage collection when using minibuffer.

```emacs-lisp
(add-hook 'emacs-startup-hook
          (lambda ()
            (if (boundp 'after-focus-change-function)
                (add-function :after after-focus-change-function
                              (lambda ()
                                (unless (frame-focus-state)
                                  (garbage-collect))))
              (add-hook 'after-focus-change-function 'garbage-collect))
            (defun gc-minibuffer-setup-hook ()
              (setq gc-cons-threshold (* better-gc-cons-threshold 2)))

            (defun gc-minibuffer-exit-hook ()
              (garbage-collect)
              (setq gc-cons-threshold better-gc-cons-threshold))

            (add-hook 'minibuffer-setup-hook #'gc-minibuffer-setup-hook)
            (add-hook 'minibuffer-exit-hook #'gc-minibuffer-exit-hook)))
```


<a id="org58e5839"></a>

## Load Path

Since all the configuration files are stored in `elisp/` folder, they need to be added to `load-path` now.

```emacs-lisp
(defun update-to-load-path (folder)
  "Update FOLDER and its subdirectories to `load-path'."
  (let ((base folder))
    (unless (member base load-path)
      (add-to-list 'load-path base))
    (dolist (f (directory-files base))
      (let ((name (concat base "/" f)))
        (when (and (file-directory-p name)
                   (not (equal f ".."))
                   (not (equal f ".")))
          (unless (member base load-path)
            (add-to-list 'load-path name)))))))

(update-to-load-path (expand-file-name "elisp" user-emacs-directory))
```


<a id="org72fe79c"></a>

## Define Constants

```emacs-lisp
(defconst *sys/win32*
  (eq system-type 'windows-nt)
  "Are we running on a WinTel system?")

(defconst *sys/linux*
  (eq system-type 'gnu/linux)
  "Are we running on a GNU/Linux system?")

(defconst *sys/mac*
  (eq system-type 'darwin)
  "Are we running on a Mac system?")

(defconst python-p
  (or (executable-find "python3")
      (and (executable-find "python")
           (> (length (shell-command-to-string "python --version | grep 'Python 3'")) 0)))
  "Do we have python3?")

(defconst pip-p
  (or (executable-find "pip3")
      (and (executable-find "pip")
           (> (length (shell-command-to-string "pip --version | grep 'python 3'")) 0)))
  "Do we have pip3?")

(defconst clangd-p
  (or (executable-find "clangd")  ;; usually
      (executable-find "/usr/local/opt/llvm/bin/clangd"))  ;; macOS
  "Do we have clangd?")

(defconst eaf-env-p
  (and *sys/linux* (display-graphic-p) python-p pip-p
       (not (equal (shell-command-to-string "pip freeze | grep '^PyQt\\|PyQtWebEngine'") "")))
  "Do we have EAF environment setup?")
```


<a id="orgcb555db"></a>

## Load Private File

An `init-private.el` file has been designated at `user-emacs-directory` for you to store personal configurations that you don't want to source-control.

```emacs-lisp
;; Load init-private.el if it exists
(when (file-exists-p (expand-file-name "init-private.el" user-emacs-directory))
  (load-file (expand-file-name "init-private.el" user-emacs-directory)))
```


<a id="orgeff467c"></a>

# Package Management

Some packages are disabled with the `:disabled` tag, because I don't use them very often. You can disable packages similarly yourself too:

```emacs-lisp
(use-package foo
  :disabled)
```


<a id="org3ec782d"></a>

## Melpa Packages

Configure package archives, where to install online packages and add them to `load-path`.

```emacs-lisp
;; Select the folder to store packages
;; Comment / Uncomment to use desired sites
(setq package-user-dir (expand-file-name "elpa" user-emacs-directory)
      package-archives
      '(("gnu"   . "https://elpa.gnu.org/packages/")
        ("melpa" . "https://melpa.org/packages/")
        ("cselpa" . "https://elpa.thecybershadow.net/packages/")
        ;; ("melpa-cn" . "http://mirrors.cloud.tencent.com/elpa/melpa/")
        ;; ("gnu-cn"   . "http://mirrors.cloud.tencent.com/elpa/gnu/")
        ))
```


<a id="orgf9c7380"></a>

## Non-Melpa Packages

Add packages contained in `site-elisp/` to `load-path` too.


### Add Packages Manually from Git

```bash
cd site-elisp/
git submodule add https://github.com/foo/bar.git
```

Verify `/.gitmodules` file that the newly added package exist.


### Update Manually Added Packages

```bash
git submodule init
git submodule update
```


<a id="orgb71e374"></a>

## Configure Package Manager

```emacs-lisp
(unless (bound-and-true-p package--initialized)
  (setq package-enable-at-startup nil)          ; To prevent initializing twice
  (package-initialize))

;; set use-package-verbose to t for interpreted .emacs,
;; and to nil for byte-compiled .emacs.elc.
(eval-and-compile
  (setq use-package-verbose (not (bound-and-true-p byte-compile-current-file))))
```


<a id="org5ce6c8d"></a>

## Use Package

My Emacs configuration is almost entirely dependant on [use-package](https://github.com/jwiegley/use-package).

> The `use-package` macro allows you to isolate package configuration in your .emacs file in a way that is both performance-oriented and, well, tidy. I created it because I have over 80 packages that I use in Emacs, and things were getting difficult to manage. Yet with this utility my total load time is around 2 seconds, with no loss of functionality!

## Java


### LSP Java

[LSP Java](https://github.com/emacs-lsp/lsp-java), Emacs Java IDE using [Eclipse JDT Language Server](https://projects.eclipse.org/projects/eclipse.jdt.ls). Note that this package is dependant on [Request](https://github.com/tkf/emacs-request).

**Prerequisite**: Install [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi) and ensure it's in `PATH`.

```emacs-lisp
(use-package lsp-java
  :after lsp-mode
  :if (executable-find "mvn")
  :init
  (use-package request :defer t)
  :custom
  (lsp-java-server-install-dir (expand-file-name "~/.emacs.d/eclipse.jdt.ls/server/"))
  (lsp-java-workspace-dir (expand-file-name "~/.emacs.d/eclipse.jdt.ls/workspace/")))
```


<a id="org139bc19"></a>

## C/C++/Objective C

**Prerequisite**: Since all completion features are provided by [LSP Mode](https://github.com/emacs-lsp/lsp-mode), it needs to setup.

-   Install [CMake](https://cmake.org/download/) >= 3.8 for all OS.
-   \*nix OS:
    -   It is suggested to use [CCLS](https://github.com/MaskRay/ccls) as LSP server. Now [build](https://github.com/MaskRay/ccls/wiki/Build) it.
    -   Set `ccls-executable` to the directory where your ccls is built.
-   Windows OS:
    -   Install [MinGW](http://www.mingw.org/wiki/Install_MinGW) for Compilation.
    -   It is a pain to build CCLS on Windows, install [Clangd](https://clang.llvm.org/extra/clangd/Installation.html) and ensure it's in `PATH` instead.


### CCLS

[Emacs CCLS](https://github.com/MaskRay/emacs-ccls), a client for [CCLS](https://github.com/MaskRay/ccls), a C/C++/Objective-C language server supporting multi-million line C++ code-bases, powered by libclang.

## Chinese

Packages and configurations suitable for Chinese users. Non-Chinese users feel free to add `:disabled` tags for them.

  :init
  (use-package posframe :defer t)
  :custom
  (default-input-method "pyim")
  (pyim-default-scheme 'quanpin)

  (pyim-page-length 9)
  :config
  (use-package pyim-basedict
    :after pyim
    :config (pyim-basedict-enable))
  (pyim-isearch-mode 1)
  (setq-default pyim-english-input-switch-functions
                '(pyim-probe-isearch-mode
                  pyim-probe-org-structure-template))
  (setq-default pyim-punctuation-half-width-functions
                '(pyim-probe-punctuation-line-beginning
                  pyim-probe-punctuation-after-punctuation))
